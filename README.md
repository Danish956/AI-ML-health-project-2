# Problem Statement
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 31% of all global deaths. In addition, there are various other health concerns that people face, which are often ignored or neglected until they become severe. This leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment, resulting in further complications and poor health outcomes.

People struggle to access medical care due to factors such as high costs, long waiting times, and lack of access to medical facilities. The global COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for accessible and efficient healthcare services.

According to survey conducted by Indian Red Cross Society nearly 70% people who require blood in india do not receive it on time. blood donation, which is a critical aspect of healthcare, is often not utilized efficiently, leading to shortages in supply during emergencies. Additionally, the lack of a centralized system for doctors to access patients' medical records and history can lead to suboptimal treatment and care.

Communication between patients and doctors is often inefficient, with long waiting times for appointments and difficulties in accessing medical advice. This leads to frustration for patients and doctors, who face an increasing workload, limited resources, and challenges in managing patient data.

## Solution
 
To address these challenges, we have developed a web application that uses machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on user health data. Our application also includes features that enable users to donate and receive blood integrated with AI ML algorithim, connect with doctors online, and manage their health data efficiently. By integrating these features into our web application, we aim to make healthcare services more accessible, convenient, and affordable for everyone, regardless of their location or socio-economic background.
 
Our machine learning model takes into account various health parameters like age, weight, blood pressure, and medical history to predict potential diseases accurately. 

Early diagnosis can help prevent severe conditions, reduce treatment costs, and improve overall health outcomes. Users can also donate or receive blood through the platform, helping save lives in critical situations.

We have also included a section for doctors to login, allowing them to provide consultations and assistance to patients online. This feature can help reduce waiting times for appointments and enable patients to access medical advice from the comfort of their homes. Our platform enables doctors to manage their appointments, access patient data, and communicate with their patients efficiently.

 ### FEATURES OF PROPOSED SOLUTION.

1. User registration- If user is new on web application first of all he have to register on the website using verified credentials like name, email id, DOB, phone number, address, user can choose their password.

2.User login- After completing the registration now user can login into the website using their credentials.

3.User friendly UI- Now user have the access of their personalize dashboard.

4.In our website there is two types of health prediction :-

a)General health prediction- in this we have created a lots of radio button of symptoms user can choose the symptoms whatever they are going through and after the our AI, ML algorithm can predict the diseases they have.

b) Heart DIseases prediction- In which user have give some input   like age, sex, cp, Trestbps, Cholestrol,  Fbs, Restecg etc

5. whatever diseases prediction user will do it will get save into history section with date and time present on the dashboard of user.

6. Our web application also have a separate features for  doctor registration, and login. on the time registration doctor have to fill the details like their address and speciality and if the doctor and patient have the same locality address then our ml algo directly suggest that doctor to the patient.

7. Our web application also have AI based blood donation and blood receiving management system. for eg- suppose you have used our model predict the diseases using our system now our ai model will also detect that whatever the diseases you are suffering from does it need any blood donation. if it need then our AI  model can also suggest that either the blood group donor is present near by you or not .

8. in market their is lots of blood donation web application are present like e-Raktosh, Red cross blood donor but they dont have any AI, ML integrated with them. but our web application is fully integrated with AI and ML.

9. Our web application also have  a separate log in system for the admin who can have access to delete the user from the web application who are just creating the spam and not having the verified caridentials.
